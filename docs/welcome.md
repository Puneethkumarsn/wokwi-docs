Wokwi is an online simulator for Arduino and Electronics. It's designed for makers, by makers.

You can use Wokwi to learn Arduino programming, prototype your ideas, and share your projects with other makers.

The documentation is still in the early stage and is missing a lot of information. If you need any help, please
hop on to our [Discord server](https://wokwi.com/discord), where a bunch of friendly community members are available
to help you.
